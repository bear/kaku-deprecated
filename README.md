書く- to write

Kaku is a Python Flask app and a small daemon designed to manage the more dynamic requirements of a modern
[IndieWeb](https://indiewebcamp.com) site.

Currently this code is very opinionated as I am writing it for use with [my own site](https://bear.im).

## Requirements and Assumptions
- Python v2.7
- Kaku is written using Flask and takes advantage of the builtin Jinja template handling
- Because Kaku needs to to store state information for authentication and authorization, it requires a Redis database
- All Micropub and Webmention calls are handled, dispatched and then an HTTP code 202 is returned.

## Features
- Micropub endpoint ```/micropub```
- Webmention endpoint ```/webmention```
- Indieauth endpoints ```/login```, ```/logout```, ```/auth``` and ```/success```
- Token generation endpoint ```/token```

Post source files that are determined to be new, updated or deleted will have a Kaku Event generated. This event is generated by either the Flask app as part of a web request, or by a command line call via kaku_events.py.

If a post is shown to have changed then the HTML for the post is generated and the index page is updated.

## Configuration

The Flask part of Kaku uses the normal Flask ```settings.py``` configuration file, see https://github.com/bear/kaku/blob/master/kaku/settings.py for reference.  kaku_events.py uses a json config file, see https://github.com/bear/kaku/blob/master/kaku_events.py for an example of it.

## Installation
All of the dependencies are outlined in a pip installable '''requirements.txt''' file.

## Running
First start the event handler

```
$ python kaku_events.py --help
usage: kaku_events.py [-h] [--config CONFIG] [--file FILE] [--force]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
  --config CONFIG
  --file FILE      A specific markdown file to check and then exit
  --force          Force any found markdown files (or specific file) to be
                   considered an update.

$ python kaku_events.py --config ./kaku_events.cfg
```

and then the Flask app

```
KAKU_SETTINGS=./kaku_settings.py uwsgi --socket 127.0.0.1:5000 --module service --callable application
```

Kaku has available the Flask style management app ```manage.py```.

## TODO
handle the following requests:

- ```GET /.well-known/browserid?domain=palala.org```
- Micropub Edit and Delete events

## Debug info

```
curl https://bear.im/micropub -d mp-action=delete -d "url=https://bear.im/2016/123/testing-delete" -H "Authorization: Bearer XXXX"

curl https://bear.im/micropub -d mp-action=undelete -d "url=https://bear.im/2016/123/testing-delete" -H "Authorization: Bearer XXXX"

python kaku_events.py --config ./kaku_events.cfg --file ~/content/2016/123/testing-delete.md --force
```

Post files example
- ```testing-delete.md``` -- markdown for the post, also contains the immutable metadata
- ```testing-delete.json``` -- metadata for post
- ```testing-delete.deleted``` -- semaphore file to mark the post as deleted
- ```testing-delete.html``` -- generated html
- ```testing-delete.mentions``` -- Webmentions that have been sent to the post
- ```testing-delete.outboundmentions``` -- json blob of any current Webmention sent from the post

```
